    "text": "Reproducibility: Reproducibility is essential for result validation in urban research. By using the R programming language, it is possible to create a working environment where analysis results, models, and data processing can be easily reproduced by others or in the future. This is achieved by organizing and documenting source code, datasets used, and procedures adopted, enabling others to understand, verify, and replicate the same steps to obtain consistent results.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science - Guide for Reproducible Research\n\n\n\nAutomation: Automation allows for the automation of complex and repetitive processes in urban research. By using the R programming language, researchers can develop scripts and programs that automate data processing, visualization creation, and report generation. This saves valuable time for researchers and reduces human errors, improving overall research efficiency.\n\n\n\nlesson\n\n\n\nScalability: Scalability is crucial for addressing complex urban challenges that require processing large amounts of data. The R programming language provides tools and packages that allow for working with large datasets, distributing processing across computer clusters, and optimizing analysis performance. This enables researchers to tackle larger-scale challenges and achieve fast and efficient results in urban research.\n\n\n\nIntroduction: slides\n\n\n\n\nOverall, automation, reproducibility, and scalability, facilitated by digital skills like the R programming language, offer a range of benefits to urban research. Automation speeds up processes and reduces errors, reproducibility ensures result validity, and scalability allows for addressing complex challenges. The use of R as a programming language provides powerful tools to implement these key functionalities, improving the efficiency and accuracy of urban research and opening new opportunities for analysis and discovery."

    "text": "“BOXES” (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) by ALA - The American Library Association\n\n\nlibrary() may be in the top most frequently used function calls in R. But what does it do? It makes tidyverse, here, sf and the like available in your code, right? However, this function call is described or perceived as “loading library x”, which is incorrect in two ways.\nFirst, the library() function does not make a “library” but a “package” available in your script. The function is called like that because it pulls a package from a location on your computer called “library”.\nIn fact, your computer may have multiple libraries visible to R in a hierarchical way. For instance, if you work with an active reproducible environment using renv, your code will search for packages called with library() in a local library specific to your project directory. This means that there may be multiple tidyverses or heres or sfs available on your computer. You can see which libraries are available (and searched for) on your computer with .libPaths().\nThe main cause of this confusion is the inconsistent use of the word “library” across languages. For instance, Python, refers to “libraries” in the sense of “packages”. While R’s terminology may contribute to this confusion, it’s still important to maintain precision in language.\nSecond, a package is not loaded but it is attached to a search path. This means that, in addition to being loaded to memory, its functions become available without the need for the :: operator. While this distinction may be less critical for everyday use, it becomes important when developing your own packages. For those interested, more details can be found in R Packages.\nConsistent use of terms is crucial for reducing confusion, especially for beginners. So, use “package” when referring to a piece of software that provides additional functionality, like tidyverse, and reserve “library” for the library() function itself or the directory where packages are stored."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In our Geospatial Data Carpentry for Urbanism workshops, we often receive the question: why R and not QGIS? Answering this question is not straightforward (both are great), so I’ll try to do it by sharing a personal experience.\nRecently, Daniele Cannatella and I gave a QGIS workshop to around 70 MSc Urbanism students at TU Delft. It did not go well as we had to deal with unforeseen technical issues for most of the workshop. We updated the problematic tutorials after the workshop to make them more accessible and to overcome such issues in the future.\n\nWhile updating the QGIS tutorial, I also tried to reproduce the process in R: in a few lines of code and fewer steps.\n\n# Load packages ----\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# Read CLC data and EEA grid ----\nclc &lt;- st_read(\"data/CLC2018/CLC2018.shp\")\neea &lt;- st_read(\"data/FRAME_EEA.gpkg\")\n\n# Create new column with Level-1 code ----\nclc &lt;- clc |&gt; \n  mutate(Level1 = str_sub(Code_18, 1, 1))\n\n# Dissolve by Level-1 CLC class ----\n# Slow ~11 minutes\nclc_dissolved &lt;- clc |&gt; \n  group_by(Level1) |&gt; \n  summarise()\n\n# Intersect CLC and EEA grid ----\n# Slow ~15 minutes\nclc_in_grid &lt;- st_intersection(eea, clc_dissolved)\n\nclc_in_grid_area &lt;- clc_in_grid |&gt; \n  mutate(area = st_area(clc_in_grid))\n\n# Create centroids from intersection ----\nclc_in_grid_centroids &lt;- st_centroid(clc_in_grid_area)\n\n# Join dominant CLC classes to original grid ----\nclc_in_grid_final &lt;- eea |&gt; \n  select(geom) |&gt; \n  st_join(clc_in_grid_centroids) |&gt; \n  group_by(CellCode) |&gt; \n  top_n(1, area)\n\n# Visualise the result ----\nggplot(clc_in_grid_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = Level1))\n\nR felt so much simpler while QGIS felt like this:\n\nThis is not to say that QGIS is worse, but that its point-and-click approach works very differently from R’s code-based approach. As I see it, R takes you to the essence of the problem you want to solve without the distractions of a Graphical User Interface. Yes, it takes more time to learn, but you can get your GIS work done with it while being able to automate, scale and ensure that your workflow is reproducible by others."

It raises awareness, stimulates engagement and builds capacity by demonstrating the benefits of reproducibility, automation and scalability for urbanism research, education and practice. The community is initiated by a group of R users in the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft, and it has the ambition to scale up to a larger national and international Rbanism community.\nOur mission is to build and sustain digital competence and skills for reproducibility, automation and scalability, in the urbanism research and education community. We cultivate scientific computing, data science, computational thinking and software management skills, through peer exchange in a growing network. To that end, our activities include workshops, many of which are carried out as part of the Carpentries, hackathons and challenges, as well as various community gatherings. We organise both offline and online events to ensure the exchange of knowledge and experiences with our international community members. These various forms of engagement follow our commitment to inclusion and accessibility."

    "text": "Why reproducibility, automation and scalability?\n\nReproducibility: Reproducibility is essential for result validation in urban research. By using the R programming language, it is possible to create a working environment where analysis results, models, and data processing can be easily reproduced by others or in the future. This is achieved by organizing and documenting source code, datasets used, and procedures adopted, enabling others to understand, verify, and replicate the same steps to obtain consistent results.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science - Guide for Reproducible Research\n\n\n\nAutomation: Automation allows for the automation of complex and repetitive processes in urban research. By using the R programming language, researchers can develop scripts and programs that automate data processing, visualization creation, and report generation. This saves valuable time for researchers and reduces human errors, improving overall research efficiency.\n\n\n\nlesson\n\n\n\nScalability: Scalability is crucial for addressing complex urban challenges that require processing large amounts of data. The R programming language provides tools and packages that allow for working with large datasets, distributing processing across computer clusters, and optimizing analysis performance. This enables researchers to tackle larger-scale challenges and achieve fast and efficient results in urban research.\n\n\n\nIntroduction: slides\n\n\n\n\nOverall, automation, reproducibility, and scalability, facilitated by digital skills like the R programming language, offer a range of benefits to urban research. Automation speeds up processes and reduces errors, reproducibility ensures result validity, and scalability allows for addressing complex challenges. The use of R as a programming language provides powerful tools to implement these key functionalities, improving the efficiency and accuracy of urban research and opening new opportunities for analysis and discovery."
